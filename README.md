# Productivity Helper

This is a simple web application that lets you create goals and check them off as you complete them. It also displays to periods of working and taking a break. This is based on the idea that people work the most efficient with a ratio of work time to free time of 5 to 1. So in this application, at the start of every half hour, a 25 minute work period begins. After the work period has completed, there a 5 minute break time.

This project was written entirely from the ground up in Elm.
